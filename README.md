# Waste-Management-aided-by-image-analysis

1. Capacity Monitoring of Waste containers using Image based data
❏ Our model would monitor the capacity of waste containers using images obtained at regular
intervals
❏ The images obtained are processed using a model trained to detect the container capacities
from image data
2. Container management system
● Based on the data collected from images
● Develop a model that would alert both the notifiers and collectors based on their requirements
3. Analysis using the image based data
❏ Using the image based data obtained to for further analysis on the waste disposed such as :
❏ Materials used for disposal
❏ Producing a report based on the collected data
