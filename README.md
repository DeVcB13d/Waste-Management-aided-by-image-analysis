# Waste-Management-aided-by-image-analysis

# Brief description
1. Capacity Monitoring of Waste containers using Image based data
    * Our model would monitor the capacity of waste containers using images obtained at regular
      intervals
* The images obtained are processed using a model trained to detect the container capacities
    from image data
2. Container management system
    * Based on the data collected from images
    * Develop a model that would alert both the notifiers and collectors based on their requirements
3. Analysis using the image based data
    * Using the image based data obtained to for further analysis on the waste disposed such as :
    * Materials used for disposal
    * Producing a report based on the collected data

# Outputs
1. # Finding the ratio upto which cans are filled
